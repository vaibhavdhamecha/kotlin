What is fragment and fragment lifecycle
-----------------

Android Fragment is the part of activity, it is also known as sub-activity. There can be more than one fragment in an activity. Fragments represent multiple screen inside one activity.

Android Fragment Lifecycle
------------
The lifecycle of android fragment is like the activity lifecycle. There are 12 lifecycle methods for fragment.

1)	onAttach(Activity)	
-> it is called only once when it is attached with activity.

2)	onCreate(Bundle)	
-> It is used to initialize the fragment.

3)	onCreateView(LayoutInflater, ViewGroup, Bundle)	
-> creates and returns view hierarchy.

4)	onActivityCreated(Bundle)	
-> It is invoked after the completion of onCreate() method.

5)	onViewStateRestored(Bundle)	
-> It provides information to the fragment that all the saved state of fragment view hierarchy has been restored.

6)	onStart()	
-> makes the fragment visible.

7)	onResume()	
-> makes the fragment interactive.

8)	onPause()	
-> is called when fragment is no longer interactive.

9)	onStop()	
-> is called when fragment is no longer visible.

10)onDestroyView()	
-> allows the fragment to clean up resources.

11)onDestroy()	
-> allows the fragment to do final clean up of fragment state.

12)onDetach()	
-> It is called immediately prior to the fragment no longer being associated with its activity.
